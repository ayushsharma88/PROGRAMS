Following are detailed steps.

1) Find inorder and preorder traversals of T, store them in two auxiliary arrays inT[] and preT[].

2) Find inorder and preorder traversals of S, store them in two auxiliary arrays inS[] and preS[].

3) If inS[] is a subarray of inT[] and preS[] is a subarray preT[], then S is a subtree of T. Else not.

We can also use postorder traversal in place of preorder in the above algorithm.

Let us consider the above example

Inorder and Preorder traversals of the big tree are.
inT[]   =  {a, c, x, b, z, e, k}
preT[]  =  {z, x, a, c, b, e, k}

Inorder and Preorder traversals of small tree are
inS[]  = {a, c, x, b}
preS[] = {x, a, c, b}

We can easily figure out that inS[] is a subarray of 
inT[] and preS[] is a subarray of preT[].
